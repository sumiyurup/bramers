Voucherstore is an eCommerce platform that serves the hospitality and leisure sector in Thailand. We are streamlining gift card and e-voucher sales in a secure online environment; we take care of our customers so they can increase revenue—and serve their clients better. Voucherstore works out of offices in Bangkok, working hard to take e-voucher sales to the world.<br><br>
Among other things, we build contemporary digital storefronts for our clients across Thailand. We do this to provide a point of sale for e-vouchers. At Vouchersrtore, we are looking to add to our startup team. At the moment, we are small, but we are growing fast!<br><br>
When you join the Voucherstore team, you gain access to some great benefits—and you get to be part of a fun team. We are a Thai/English-speaking workplace, so you will have the opportunity to brush up on both! Our team will have the opportunity to grow together, and taking care of business with efficiency and drive means a brighter future all around.<br><br>
Voucherstore is a forward-thinking employer: that’s why we offer a 35-hour working week. We want our team to earn, but we also understand that a good work/life balance makes you more productive. We offer health insurance to all our employees, and our onsite team also receives free lunches and access to a snack bar.<br><br>
If you want to join a team that values its employees and their customers, get in touch with Voucherstore today to submit an application. "
